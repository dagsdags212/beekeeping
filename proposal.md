- explore export feasibility of premium PH honey

### Operations

- train staff in queen rearing techniques
- acquire small-scale cold storage for pollen and royal jelly trials

## Year 4: Queen Rearing and Scaling Value-Added Products

:::{hint} Goal
Establish higher-margin product lines and bee breeding program.
:::

### Expansion

- reach 120-150 hives
- target annual yield of 4,000 kg honey/year
- offer new products and services:
  - queen rearing program to produce and sell 200-400 queens/year @ PHP 1000/queen
  - scale up propolis tinctures and pollen supplements
