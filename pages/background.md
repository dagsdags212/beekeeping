# Background

Beekeeping is a small-to-moderate scale agribusiness with rising demand (natural foods, cosmetics, nutraceuticals) and 
good diversification opportunities (wax, pollen, royal jelly, pollination services), but it faces supply-chain risks (adulteration), 
disease & seasonality and requires upfront equipment/skills to scale profitably.

## Market Size and Capitalization

- Global honey market is valued at ~USD 9 billion in 2023-2024
- forecasts of steady growth (~3-5% CAGR) reflecting the market's strong interest in natural sweeteners
- Bee product market in Asia is growing faster than the global average, driven by demand for apitherapy and functional ingredients
- Philippine market is small relative to large produces (~USD 20-30 million), but growing 

## Prices and Demand Signals

- Global farmgate/wholesale prices range between \$3 (for bulk industrial honey) to \$9 (for specialty honey)
- In the Philippines, raw honey typically sells roughly PHP ~760-1,320 / kg
- Demand drivers include:
  - health trends
  - functional food and cosmetics
  - local/traceable food interest
  - pollination services for fruit and nut crops

## Cost and Accessibility

:::{aside} Commercial Starter Sets
Starter kits typically cost PHP 15,000 per colony. The kit includes a nuc colony, hive box, and multiple hive frames.
:::

Typical cost elements include:

1. Hive equipement
2. Nuc Colonies
3. Protective gear and tools
4. Consumables and inputs
5. Labor and transport
6. Compliance, processing, and marketing

  
## Competition and Industry Risks

### Competition

- competition includes small commercial beekeepers, wild honey collectors, local cooperatives, and packaged imported honey in retail channels
  - market access is often local markets, farmers' markets, health stores, and online direct sales
- import competition undercuts local prices

### Risks

- adulteration serves as a global risk
  - sugar-infused honey that are marked as _pure_ degrades consumer trust
  - emphasis on traceability to protect brand quality
- biosecurity, pests and disease
  - varroa mites can kill entire colonies of not treated
  - good husbandry, monitoring, and access to veterinary inputs are critical

## Scalability 

Economies of scale reduces per-kg cost by:

- amortizing extraction and bottling equipment across more hives
- negotiating better input prices
- specializing labor
  
Contraints for scaling includes:

- forage availability (seasonal nectar flows)
- land use conflicts
  - bees are sensitive to pesticides and insecticides
- local regulations (not much domestic regulations)
- access to reliable labour

Honey production is the primary revenue sources, but other streams include:

- bee products (beeswax, propolis, pollen, royal jelly)
- pollination contracts
- ecotourism
- queen rearing
- training and seminars

## Pros and Cons

|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Low land footprint - hives take little space per unit|Seasonality: nectar flows vary and income fluctuats across months|
|Multiple revenue streams|Upfront equipment and skill requirements|
|Relatively low ongoing feed costs in good forage areas|Biosecurity and disease risk|
|Start small and scale accordingly|Market trust and adulteration problems, brand differentiation is difficult|
|Positive environmental co-benefits (crop pollination)|Labor-intensive at scale|
|Opportunity for premium pricing|Competition from cheap imported bulk honey in commodity channels|
